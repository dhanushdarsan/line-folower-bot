## 🌟 Introduction

A line follower robot is a type of autonomous robot that can follow a path or trajectory, usually a black line on a white surface or vice versa. This project demonstrates how to build a line follower robot using an Arduino microcontroller, providing a practical introduction to robotics and electronics.

## ✨ Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot follows a line without human intervention.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Detects obstacles and halts movement to avoid collisions.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Easily adjust the robot's speed using a potentiometer.
- **Cost-Effective**: Built using readily available and affordable components.

## 🛠️ Components Required

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno or similar
- **Motor Driver**: L298N or similar
- **DC Motors**: 2 units
- **Chassis**: With wheels
- **Line Sensors**: IR sensors or similar
- **Battery Pack**: For powering the robot
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Breadboard**
- **Miscellaneous**: Resistors, capacitors
